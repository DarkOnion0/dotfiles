# DarkOnion's dotfiles
My personal dotfiles for my *nix system (actually it's [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/))

# Shell 🐚

## Fish 🐠

* ArchLinux
```sh
pacman -S fish && chsh -s /bin/fish <USERNAME>
```

## VSCodium 
VSCodium is only avaible in the AUR, so you should install an AUR helper like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru)
* ArchLinux
```sh
yay -S vscodium-bin
```
I packed my installed extension in a zip archive named `.vscode-oss.zip`
